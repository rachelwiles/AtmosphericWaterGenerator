# Atmospheric Water Generator Simulation :droplet:

## Simulating the output of an Atmospheric Water Generator in MATLAB for water output in remote regions of the world.

### Project in conjunction with Convert Energy, who supplied the PV solar panels for the build of the product.

**Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) designed and constructed in laboratory sessions. Parameters used in the simulations reflect climates of chosen locations across the world, and the performance of the AWG in the test area UK.**

This simulation uses bilinear interpolation to extrapolate the results of UK test data to remote areas around the world.
